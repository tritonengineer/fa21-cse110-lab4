1. The final value of i after the completion of the for loop will be presented in the console log at line 12. i can be accessed due to the var keyword which means the variable has scope across the entire function.
2. The value of the discountedPrice variable will be presented in the console log at line 13. The discountedPrice variable can be accessed due to the var keyword which means the variable has scope across the entire function.
3. The value of finalPrice after the for loop has completed will be presented in the console log at line 14. The updated value of this variable can be accessed due to the var keyword which means the variable has scope across the entire function.
4. This function will return an array of the discounted prices and the updated value of this variable can be accessed due to the var keyword which means the variable has scope across the entire function.
5. The code will cause an error because line 12 cannot access the value of the variable i due to the let keyword which means that i can only be accessed within the scope of the for loop.
6. Line 13 will cause an error since the discountedPrice variable was declared in the for loop code block and the let keyword indicates that this variable can only be accessed within this for loop.
7. Line 14 will have the updated finalPrice value  be presented in the console because the let keyword indicates that the finalPrice variable can be accessed within the scope of the function.
8. This function returns the updated array stored in the discounted variable since the let keyword gives the variable the scope within the function.
9. Line 11 will cause an error since the i variable has the let keyword which means it can only be accessed within the for loop code block.
10. The length of the prices array will be presented in the console log since the length variable is const and it can be accessed within the code block of the function.
11. This function will cause an error since there is an attempt to change the value of the variable for the discounted array which is a const that cannot be edited.
12. A. student.name B. student.'Grad Year' C. student.greeting D. student.'Favorite Teacher'.name E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. A. '32' since integers map to string representation
    B. 1 since it mapped to 3 - 2 integer representation
    C. 3 since null maps to the equivalent of zero
    D. '3null' since null maps to its string representation
    E. 4 since true maps to 1 and 1 + 3 = 4
    F. 0 since false and null map to 0
    G. '3undefined' since undefined maps to a string representation
    H. NaN since undefined maps to NaN
14. A. true since 2 maps to an integer representation
    B. false
    C. true since '2' maps to an integer representation
    D. false since the two values are not of the same type
    E. false
    F. true since both values are of the same type of boolean    
15. While the == operator accounts for conversions and check equality, the === operator also checks if the two compared values are of the same type.
